engine.
It is developped as a school project @ISEN-Lille.

## Key features
* Animated 3D model
* Command-line argument for bulk command parsing

 * Jessica Fridrich


## Requirements
As of today, Rubiksawesome is implemented for compilation with `gcc` on a
GNU/Linux system. **Windows is not supported, nor it ever will be**.

For documentation generation, `doxygen` is required.
